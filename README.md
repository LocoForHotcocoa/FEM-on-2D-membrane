# my final project from Computational Physics (PHYS 163) at CSUS

This app computes the modes of the 2D wave equation on a circle and can be used for any continuous function for ```f(R) = 0```.

## Things that I want to work on:

- Use more sophisticated approximation method
    - Could use some mesh method for wave equation
    - Will need to learn more math
- Make the tool more user-friendly
    - Somehow allow entire function to be read in by the user
    - Maybe json file for parameters?
- Make a Docker image for compatability
