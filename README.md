# my final project from Computational Physics (PHYS 163) at CSUS

This app computes the modes of the 2D wave equation on a circle with FEM and can be used for any continuous function for ```f(R) = 0```.

In order to run, the following python packages must be installed:
- ```matploblib```
- ```meshpy```
- ```numpy```
- ```ffmpeg``` (optional, for saving animations)
- ```argparse```

*TODO*: To run the old version with no FEM (my actual submitted project from PHYS 163): 
```python main.py --old```

## Things that I am working on currently
- Updating directory and making things align with best practices
- adding input flags with ```argparse```
- adding old version as an option to run

## Things that I want to work on:
- Make the tool more user-friendly
    - Somehow allow entire function to be read in by the user
    - Maybe json file for parameters? idk
